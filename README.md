Simple dice rollers

The drop down menu modifies how many dice rolls are simulated; a popup reveals how much each dice roll and the sum of all the rolls.


### future plans
dice queuing to roll different types of dice at the same time (eg. 1 d6 3 d4)
add advantage, disadvantage button for DnD
add a "fumble" button for GM
  contextually? generalized bad luck?
change popup message to print in console
  feedback suggested the popup was a little bothersome when rolling multiple kinds of dice
save all dice rolls to a log file
